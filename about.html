    Assalm-u-Alaikum, 
    I'm a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    I specialize in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.  
    I've created projects like product landing pages, blogs, and personal portfolios,  
    and I enjoy turning ideas into professional web experiences.
    Currently, I'm expanding my skills and sharing my work through GitHub and
     freelancing platforms.  
    My goal is to help clients build modern websites that look great
     and work smoothly on all devices.
